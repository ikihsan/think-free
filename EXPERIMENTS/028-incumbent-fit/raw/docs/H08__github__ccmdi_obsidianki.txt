## Installation

```bash
# uv
uv tool install obsidianki
# uv (source)
uv tool install https://github.com/ccmdi/obsidianki.git

# pip
pip install obsidianki
# pip (source)
pip install https://github.com/ccmdi/obsidianki.git
```

## Why?
Obsidian is a knowledge store. You write notes without the explicit intention of reviewing them later. The knowledge in Obsidian is **unstructured** (natural language), and forcing flashcard review into Obsidian via manual question/answer pairs is making it something it fundamentally isn't.

Anki, on the other hand, is an application exactly for purposeful review. Anki is inherently **structured** via "question/answer" flashcard format. 

To get the best of both worlds, knowledge management in Obsidian and review scheduling in Anki, we need to translate the unstructured notes to structured flashcards. **Bridging this gap is the main goal of ObsidianKi**.

## Setup

Run:
```bash
obsidianki
```

This will start the interactive setup. Here's what you'll need:

1. **Obsidian access (pick one in setup):**
   - **Obsidian CLI** (Obsidian 1.12+): enable Command line interface in Settings → General and register the CLI.
   - **Local REST API**: install the [plugin](https://github.com/coddingtonbear/obsidian-local-rest-api) and copy the API key from its settings.

2. **AnkiConnect setup:**
   - Add-on code: `2055492159`
   - Keep Anki running

The interactive setup will guide you through model selection and configuration.

## Usage

```bash
oki                                # Generate from random old notes
oki --notes "React"                # Generate from specific note
oki --notes "frontend/*:3"         # Sample 3 notes from folder
oki -q "What is X?"                # Standalone query (no source note)
oki --notes "React" -q "hooks"     # Targeted extraction from note
```

See the [reference](docs/usage.md) for all commands and options.
